Cardfight Vanguard 

A trading card game that started out as a manga created by Author Akira Itou and eventually made its debut as a TCG back in 2011 with its first two trial decks, “Blaster Blade” and “Dragonic Overlord”, and its first booster set, “Descent of the King of Knights”, a few weeks later. Its mechanics can be said to be less complex and deep than its competitors, but it has been able to become one of the very few TCG’s to continue to stay alive even after years of releases, even going strong up until this day. Only earning less than the “Big 3” of trading card games: Yugioh, MTG and Pokemon.

In the narrative of the game, players are spirits who have wandered to a distant planet known as Cray. Because of their current state as powerless spirits, they have no choice but to enlist the help of the various creatures and factions of the land to settle their conflict. The game has given a very detailed history of the planet that might be as deep as the history of our past 2000 years. However, to keep things concise, I will only give descriptions of the 6 nations of the planet and the factions within them. 

 

United Sanctuary –photo-- 

A small nation that is described as a “holy nation”. It adapts a monarchy as its system of government, however their traditional culture and way of governing cannot be made as a basis of how much their technology has advanced because they possess technology far superior to ours in modern times. 

Factions/Clans:

Royal Paladins 

-A clan primarily composed of holy knights, their aids, wizards, and fairies. They are the main defense force of the united sanctuary and loved and idolized by many.

Shadow Paladins 

-A clan seen as the opposite of the Royal Paladins. They are primarily composed of dark knights, witches, assassins and the like. Despite their name, they have been one of the most crucial in ensuring the survival of the united sanctuary as they are responsible for completing the “dirty work” needed to keep the nation stable while staying in the shadows. They have been so thorough in their work to the point that some even doubt if they exist at all.

Oracle Think Tank 

-A corporation comprised of gods, human fortune tellers, and the like. Led by their CEO Amaterasu, they provide services in economic forecasting, clairvoyance, love divination and fortune telling.

Angel Feather 

-An organization comprised primarily of angels that specialize in medicine and healing magic. They serve as the main medical organization of the country

Genesis 

-A rival of the oracle think tank in a way as they are also a corporation primary composed of gods. Their business has many branches, some including research on ancient technology, research on offensive magic and security.

Gold Paladins 

-There was a time when the planet cray entered a great war. During this war, both royal and shadow paladin clans were greatly damaged. Because of this, some members of the two clans decided to set aside their differences and join forces. After the war, the two clans slowly recuperated but some members of that alliance decided to stay together and form the gold paladins.

Dragon Empire 

-The largest of all of the nations. Even with less advances in technology compared to other nations. They have been able to maintain their large territory with their raw strength 

 

Kagero 

-The land assault troop of the dragon empire. They are primarily composed of fire dragons and are one of the most elite corps in the empire. With their strength, they can render even the most modern weaponry useless. 

Nubatama 

-The corps assigned with covert tasks like espionage.  Primarily composed of dark dragons, they value their missions above all else and are willing to choose death if it meant a higher chance of success.  

Tachikaze 

- Another assault troop of the empire. However, unlike the kagero, they are primarily made up of dragons that resemble dinosaurs and focus on technological advancements instead of physical strength to win. They have a long and storied history, once even being the most powerful force in the empire before their decline. 

Murakumo 

-A former branch of the Nubatama that became independent overtime. Because of their history, they primarily handle similar tasks to the Nubatama. They are the most mysterious and secretive of the clans of the empire, with no one even knowing their leader’s name or face. 

Narukami 

-A clan of thunder dragons that were second only to the Kagero in terms of military strength. During the time when cray entered a great war and many of the Kagero were incapacitated, the Narukami took up their mantle as the empire’s main offensive and defensive force.
